This is assignment 6 for the Berkeley Bootcamp

# Project Overview
the first part of this project is about pulling hundreds of cities from geoapify and comparing the cities latitude, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed to see if there is a correlation between that data
the second part is plotting these cities with their nearest hotels on a map using hv plot.


## Part1 Overview
The First section that we discovered is that the only definitive coorlation is between latitude and Max temp, which does a U-shaped graph, because the middle counts as the equator and the farther you get from the equator, the colder it gets. Everything else there is no coorelation when regarded to the latitude.

## Part 2 Overview
This part is more of practice in plotting graphs on a map
